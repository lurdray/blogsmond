						<h4 class="p-title"><b>About Raymond</b></h4>
						<p>Hey there!, Ok I'm a graduate of Physics Electronics from the Federal University of Technology, Minna - Niger State.<br />
						Baged my Bachelor of Technology in Physics in the year 2018, Ive been a developer for a while now.
						</p>
						<br />
						
						<h4 class="p-title"><b>About Blogsmond</b></h4>
						<p>Well..., Blogsmond started off as a trend-analysis blog site. However not anymore, i find it really uneasy to handle. Moreover, the news-blogsphere is highly saturated: So blogsmond is now a self development, Bussiness Guide, Enterpreneur Hack, Job Adverts and Scholarship Advert Blog App! <br />
						Sounds too much for just one Blog App ?. I know right! Actually, No it isn't, trust me the listed case studies circle around themselves and i am going to prove that to you!<br />
						Yeah, this Blog App would also offer some cool Web Apps(simply select Blogsmond Apps from the menu to discover), forgive my love for Web app development<br />
						Some of these apps might be fun, others may offer you credible functions to acheive a solution as you go through these series.</p>
